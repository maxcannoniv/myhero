      <p class="classes-subtitle">The city is on its knees, and we can't afford to wait for someone else to act. These are the roles we need filled — now. If you think you have what it takes, step forward. No one is coming to save us. We save ourselves.</p>

        <p class="class-flavor">
          You didn't ask for this. But when the building came down and you were
          the only one still standing, the city took notice. Strength isn't a
          choice — it's a responsibility. You hit hard, you move fast, and you
          don't stay down.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Celebrity</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          You were famous before the cape. Millions follow your every move. One
          post from you shifts the city's mood. You don't fight crime with fists —
          you fight it with influence. The camera is always watching. Make it count.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Politician</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          Power isn't taken. It's negotiated. You know every faction leader by
          first name. You've brokered deals in back rooms that kept the peace —
          and a few that didn't. The city is a chessboard, and you've been
          playing longer than anyone knows.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Sleuth</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          Everyone has secrets. You find them. A trail of receipts, a misplaced
          phone call, a shadow that doesn't match the body — you see what others
          miss. The truth doesn't hide from you. It just takes a little longer
          to come out.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Tycoon</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          Money talks. Yours shouts. You built an empire from nothing, and now
          every faction wants a piece of your bankroll. But you didn't get here
          by being generous — you got here by being smart. Every dollar is a
          weapon. Every deal is a chess move.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Visionary</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          While everyone else reacts, you predict. You see the shape of things
          before they form. Tech, trends, movements — you're always three steps
          ahead. Some call you a dreamer. The smart ones call you first.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Mogul</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          You don't just have money — you have reach. Media, finance, real estate.
          When you speak, markets move. When you're silent, people worry. The city
          runs on influence, and you've cornered the supply.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Mercenary</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          Loyalty is a luxury. You work for whoever pays, and you always deliver.
          No ideology, no allegiance — just results and a wire transfer. The city's
          factions all pretend they don't need you. They all have your number.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Champion</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          You fight, but you also perform. Every punch is a headline. Every
          victory is a show. The arena made you, but the city keeps you. Fans
          chant your name. Enemies know it too. You're not just strong — you're
          unforgettable.

        <h3 class="class-name">The Philanthropist</h3>
        <p class="class-flavor">
          You give. Not because you have to — because you understand something
          others don't. Loyalty can't be bought, but it can be earned. Every
          shelter funded, every community lifted — that's power no faction can
          take from you.
